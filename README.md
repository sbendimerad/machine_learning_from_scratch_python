# machine_learning_from_scratch_python
Welcome to our journey into the heart of machine learning algorithms, recreated from scratch using Python. 
This repository is for those who seek a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work by exploring their basic principles through coding.

## Why This Repository?
The aim is simple: to peel back the layers of complexity surrounding machine learning algorithms and understand their core by implementing them from the ground up. This is a place for learners of all levels to see the nuts and bolts of ML models.

## What's Inside?
Basic Algorithm Implementations: Code and exemple with data.

Feel free to fork, submit pull requests, or suggest new algorithms or improvements. This is a collaborative space to learn and share knowledge about machine learning.

Let's Learn Together
Dive into the code, experiment with it, and join us in demystifying machine learning, one algorithm at a time.
