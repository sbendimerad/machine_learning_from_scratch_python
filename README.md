# Machine Learning from Scratch

Welcome to the "Machine Learning from Scratch" repository, where we dive deep into the nuts and bolts of machine learning algorithms. This repository is dedicated to those who wish to grasp the underlying mechanics of ML algorithms by implementing them from the ground up in Python.

## Introduction

Machine learning is a cornerstone of modern technology, powering everything from search engines to self-driving cars. Understanding how these algorithms work under the hood is crucial for both aspiring data scientists and seasoned professionals. This repository aims to demystify these complex algorithms by breaking them down into their most fundamental parts and rebuilding them step by step.

## What's Inside

- **Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)**: See how combining the predictions of multiple models can improve accuracy.
- **Kmeans** : See how kmeans clustering works.
- **And more...**: Coming soon.
